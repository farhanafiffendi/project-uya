<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

One of the important things in health institutions to serve the community is medical devices. Health agencies need quality health services that are technological and accurate so as not to hinder the community's right to obtain health services. Not only that, nurses have difficulty in monitoring the TTV condition of inpatients regularly. This can be overcome by health agencies if they have medical devices that are in accordance with health standards that can monitor the patient's condition so that nurses can check the patient's condition in real-time. With the fulfillment of accurate and technology , health workers, especially nurses, will work optimally to provide the best health services for the community.

Here's why:
* AWAXI contributes to minimizing delays in checking and treating patients, especially in critical conditions
* Patient data recorded on the AWAXI website can be used as a reference by the health agency for further examinations
* Families can find out the patient's condition in real time even though they are not in the patient's room
* Nurses can monitor the patient's condition in real time without having to come to the patient's room continuously

Of course, Patient Monitoring Systems with web and android applications that can connect patients with nurses Do not yet exist, especially in monitoring conditions and displaying information on patient conditions in real-time!!!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
